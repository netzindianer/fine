# Model

Object interface to work with tables (Active Record, ORM, Table Data Gateway).

## Requirements

- The models are located in `app/m` catalogue.
- The name of a model is the same as name of a table.
- The field names in model are the same as field names in a database table.
- The model name can not contain an underscore.
- The field names in the tables are unique in the entire database.
- The primary key name in the model is `modelname_id`.
- The foreign key to other model is `modelname_id_othermodelname`.
- The models inherit from the class `f_m` (directly or indirectly).
- The field that contains the creation time of a record in TIMESTAMP format has a name `modelname_insert`.
- The field that contains the update time of a record in TIMESTAMP format has a name `modelname_update`.
- The field that contains the number of related records from other table (other related models) has a name `modelname_count_othermodelname`.

## Class outline

```php
<?php

class f_m
{

    /**
     * Connection with database
     */
    public function db(); // returns the connection object of type f_db_mysql

    /**
     * Fields
     * - taken into account in queries SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE 
     * - when setting and getting models value for Active Record, for example method `val`
     */
    public function field($absField = null); // sets/gets fields
    public function addField($asField);      // adds field/fields
    public function removeField($asField);   // removes field/fields
    public function fieldBack();             // Restores the last state of fields
    public function defaultField();          // Sets fields as standard

    /**
     * Models value
     */
    public function val($aKeyValue = null, $asRestrictionField = null); // Sets, gets values for an Active Record 
    public function fieldAndVal($aKeyValue); // Sets array keys as fields and sets values 
    public function data();                  // Gets selected data, alias (only getter) for a property `$this->_` 
    public function id($sValue = null);      //  Gets or sets id of a record

    /**
     *  Parameters for queries
     */
    public function param($asKey = null, $sValue = null); // Gets/sets the parameter/parameters
    public function paramId($isId = null);                // Gets/sets the parameter id of a record 
    public function paramPaging();                        // Paging of data, inserts paging to params
    public function isParam($sKey);                       // Checks if parameter exists
    public function removeParam($asKey = null);           // Removes parameter/parameters

    /**
     * Selecting
     */
    public function select($aisParam = null);   // Record - Active Record (equivalent of f_db_mysql->row)
    public function selectAll($aParam = null);  // Records (equivalent of f_db_mysql->rows)
    public function selectCol($aParam = null);  // Column (equivalent of f_db_mysql->col)
    public function selectCols($aParam = null); // Two columns as an associative array (equivalent of f_db_mysql->cols)
    public function selectVal($aParam = null);  // Value (equivalent of f_db_mysql->val)
    public function selectCount($aParam = null, $sExpr = '*'); // Counts the number of records
    public function selectLoop($aParam = null); // Getting records in a loop (equivalent of f_db_mysql->query)
    public function selectNext();               // Getting records in a loop (equivalent of f_db_mysql->fetch)
    public function selectInserted();           // Selecting last inserted record


    /**
     * Fetching - the same as selecting + selected data is returned 
     */
    public function fetch($aisParam = null);   // equivalent of select
    public function fetchAll($aParam = null);  // equivalent of selectAll

    public function fetchCount($aParam = null, $sExpr = '*'); // equivalent of selectCount
    public function fetchNext();               // equivalent of selectNext
    public function fetchInserted();           // equivalent of selectinserted

    /**
     * Inserting, updating, deleting records 
     */
    public function insert($aData = null);    // Inserts record
    public function insertAll($aData = null); // Inserts many records with one query
    public function update($aData = null, $aisParam = null); // updates record/records
    public function updateAll($aData = null); // updates all records in the table
    public function delete($aisParam = null); // removes record/records
    public function save($aData = null, $iId = null); // If there is `id()` of model then `update()`, else `insert()`

    /**
     *  Relations
     */

    public function relations();
    // Custom relations are defined in appropriate model inside a method 
    // It is not necessary to definie standard relations , ORM knows what is connected with what 

    public function relation($sName, $sThisField = null, $sRelatedField = null, $asCondition = null);
    // Defining the relations (or downloading)

    public function join($sRelation, $asField = null, $sModel = null, $sJoinAlias = null, $sModelAlias = null);
    // JOIN - method adds to parameters field join with metadata of connection, deleting parameter join will disable relation 

    public function joinLeft($sRelation, $asField = null, $sModel = null, $sJoinAlias = null, $sModelAlias = null);
    // LEFT JOIN

    public function dependent($sDependentModelName);
    // Dependent model, later it is possible to reference this kind of model with  `__get($sDependentModelName)`   

    /**
     * Additional
     */
    public function paging(); // object paging
    
}
?>

```
## Sample class of models

```php
<?php

class m_user extends f_m
{

    public $user_id;
    public $user_name;
    public $user_email;
    public $user_pass;

}

class m_post extends f_m
{

    public $post_id;
    public $post_id_user;
    public $post_insert;
    public $post_title;
    public $post_text;
    public $post_count_comment;

}

class m_comment extends f_m
{

    public $comment_id;
    public $comment_id_post;
    public $comment_insert;
    public $comment_ip;
    public $comment_author;
    public $comment_text;

}

?>
```

## Active Record

```php
<?php

$oUser = new m_user();
$oUser->user_name  = 'Jan';
$oUser->user_pass  = '1234';
$oUser->user_email = 'john1980@address.com';
$oUser->save();
$oUser->selectInserted();
// Executes query SELECT * FROM model WHERE model_id = LAST_INSERT_ID() 
// therefore standard values ​​defined in MySQL are available in the model

$oPost = new m_post();
$oPost->post_id_user = $oUser->user_id;
$oPost->post_insert  = time();
$oPost->post_title   = 'First post on blog'; 
$oPost->post_text    = 'Content of first post on blog';
$oPost->save();

$oUser2 = new m_user();
$oUser2->select($oUser->id());
$oUser2->user_email = 'john1980@address.com';
$oUser2->save();

?>
```

## Selecting

### One record

#### By primary key

```php
<?php

$oPost = new m_post();
$oPost->select(1234);

echo $oPost->post_id;
echo $oPost->post_title;
echo $oPost->post_text;

?>
```

On passed value of the method; the function mysql_real_escape_string is executed automatically before executing a query

#### By colums value

```php
<?php

//SELECT post_id, post_id_user, post_insert, post_title, post_text, post_count_comment FROM post WHERE post_title = 'New post'
$oPost = new m_post();
$oPost->select(array('post_title' => 'New post'));

//SELECT post_id, post_id_user, post_insert, post_title, post_text, post_count_comment FROM post WHERE post_title = 'New post' AND post_time = '123456789'
$oPost = new m_post();
$oPost->select(array('post_title' => 'New post', 'post_time' => 123456789));

?>
```

The `select` method automatically assigns the values of the selected record ​​to the fields of the objects model.
The `val` method gets and sets model fields.

Methods `select*` are not returning the selected data no more. 
The model now holds the data. 
To get the data from the model it is required to reference to the property `_` or to the method `data()`. 
If we want to get the data immediately we should use methods `fetch*`.


#### Many records

To select many records there is a method selectAll.
```php
<?php

//SELECT post_id, post_id_user, post_insert, post_title, post_text, post_count_comment FROM post WHERE post_id_user = '1'
$this->v->post = m_post::_()->fetchAll(array('post_id_user' => 1));

?>
```

#### Only chosen fields

```php
<?php

//SELECT post_title, post_count_comment FROM post WHERE post_id_user = '1'
$this->v->post = m_post::_()
                    ->field(array('post_title', 'post_count_comment')) // or fields as a string where following fields separated by a space
                    ->fetchAll(array('post_id_user' => 1))

?>
```

#### One column

For example all IDs of posts of user with ID = 1 as an associative array

```php
<?php

//SELECT post_id FROM post WHERE post_id_user = '1'
$oPost = new m_post();
$oPost->field('post_id');
$aPostUser = $oPost->fetchCol(array('post_id_user' => 1));
foreach ($aPostUser as $post_id) {
    echo $post_id . '<br />';
}

?>
```

#### Two columns

For example all IDs and time of posts of user with ID = 1 as one-dimensional array where ID is a key and time is a value of an element of an array.

```php
<?php

//SELECT post_id, post_insert FROM post WHERE post_id_user = '1'
$oPost = new m_post();
$oPost->field('post_id post_insert');
$aPostUser = $oPost->fetchCols(array('post_id_user' => 1));
foreach ($aPostUser as $post_id => $post_insert) {
    echo $post_id . ' - ' . $post_insert . ' <br />';
}

?>
```
#### The values of one field in one record 

For example the title of the post with ID 1234

```php
<?php

//SELECT post_title FROM post WHERE post_id = '1234'
$oPost = new m_post();
$oPost->field('post_title');
$sTitle = $oPost->fetchVal(array('post_id' => 1234));

?>
```

### Advanced selecting

```php
<?php
$oPost = new m_post();
$oPost->selectAll(array(
    'post_id_user'   => array(1, 3, 5),
    'order by'       => 'post_id DESC',
    'field'          => array('COUNT(*) as xxx', 'post_id_user'),
    'group'          => 'post_id_user',
    'having'         => 'xxx > 1',
    'offset'         => 10,
    'limit'          => 10,
    'post_insert >=' => time() - 60*60*24*7
));
//Generates query: 
//SELECT post_id, post_insert, post_title, post_name, post_text, post_count_comment
//FROM post
//WHERE post_id_user IN('1','3','5') AND post_insert >= '1232733645'
//GROUP BY post_id_user
//HAVING xxx > 1
//ORDER BY post_id DESC
//LIMIT 10
//OFFSET 10

?>
```

#### Selecting according to SQL query 

```php
<?php

$oPost = new m_post();
$aPost = $oPost->db()->rows("
    SELECT post_id, post_insert, post_title, post_name, post_text, post_count_comment
    FROM post
    WHERE post_id_user IN('1','3','5') AND post_insert >= '1232733645'
    GROUP BY post_id_user
    HAVING xxx > 1 ORDER BY post_id DESC
    LIMIT 10
    OFFSET 10
");

?>
```

### Updating
```php
<?php

$oUser = new m_user();
$oUser->select(1);
$oUser->user_name  = 'John Smith';
$oUser->user_pass  = '12345';
$oUser->user_email = 'john1980@address.com';
$oUser->save();

?>
```

```php
<?php

$oUser = new m_user();
$oUser->user_id    = 1;
$oUser->user_name  = 'John Smith';
$oUser->user_pass  = '12345';
$oUser->user_email = 'john1980@address.com';
$oUser->save();

?>
```

```php
<?php

$oUser = new m_user();
$oUser->id(1);
$oUser->user_name  = 'John Smith';
$oUser->user_pass  = '12345';
$oUser->user_email = 'john1980@address.com';
$oUser->save();

?>
```

### Deleting

```php
<?php

$oUser = new m_user();
$oUser->delete(1);

?>
```

```php
<?php

$oUser = new m_user();
$oUser->user_id = 1;
$oUser->delete();

?>
```

```php
<?php

$oUser = new m_user();
$oUser->id(1);
$oUser->delete();

?>
```
Delete function will not remove all records when we don't give records ID as an argument or when we didn't set the primary key value before

```php
<?php

$oUser = new m_user();
$oUser->delete();

?>
```
In this case no record will be removed. This functionality is for security reasons to avoid errors like for giving an argument with value null
To remove all the records from the table one should execute delete(array(1)), it would generate a query: DELETE FROM user WHERE 1

## Paging of data

### f_paging

```php
<?php

class f_paging
{

    public function all($iAllItems = null);     // Sets/gest the number of all elements
    public function page($iCurrentPage = null); // Sets/gest the current page
    public function limit($iLimit = null);      // Sets/gest the number of elements per site

    public function paging(); // Makes paging calculations

    public function pages();  // Gets the number of all pages
    public function offset(); // Gets the offset of the first element of the current site
    public function next();   // Gets the number of the next site (or null)
    public function prev();    // Gets the number of the previous site (or null)

    public function render(); // Renders using view helper

    public function helper($sHelper = null); // Sets/gets name of the view helper 

    public function uri($asUri = null);           // Sets/gets an address used by    
                                                  // the view helper to generate urls 
    public function uriParam($sUriParam = null);  // Sets/gets parameter name of a task 
                                                  // in which the current page number is kept
    public function uriVar($sUriVariable = null); // Marker to generate an address when uri  
                                                  // is set as a string

    public function param($asKey, $sValue = null); // Additional parameters
    public function isParam($sKey);                // for example for f_v_helper_paging we can give `width`. `href`, `onclick`
    public function removeParam($asKey = null);    //

}
?>
```

### Model

```php
<?php

$article = new m_article();
$article->param('article_type', 'mag');
$article->paramPaging();
$article->selectAll();

?>
```

```php
<?php

class f_m
{

    public function paramPaging()
    {
        $this->paging()
                ->all($this->fetchCount())
                ->paging();

        $this->param(self::PARAM_PAGING, $this->paging());
    }

}
?>
```
               
`paramPaging()` is referencing to the object of model paging (`paging()`).
Sets the number of all elements, runs paging, sets the parameter paging.
If we don't give an actual page number then `f_paging` tries to figure it out by its own `uriParam`.
We can by ourselves set the page and other parameters 

```php
<?php

$article = new m_article();
$article->param('article_type', 'mag');
$article->paging()->limit(20)->page(5)->uri(array('news', 'list'));
$article->paramPaging();
$article->selectAll();

?>
```

## ORM - Object-relational mapping

Object-relational mapping (ORM, O/RM, and O/R mapping) in computer software is a programming technique for converting data between incompatible type systems in object-oriented programming languages. 
This creates, in effect, a "virtual object database" that can be used from within the programming language. There are both free and commercial packages available that perform object-relational mapping, 
although some programmers opt to create their own ORM tools.

Source: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-relational_mapping)

It is not necessary to define basic relations. 
ORM searches for relations in this order:
1. Defined by method relation
2. relation n:1
3. relation 1:n
4. relation 1:1

Custom relations are defined in method `relations` using the method `relation`, for example:

We have the table `attachment`, which can be connected to many different modules.
```php
<?php

class m_attachment extends f_m
{

    public function relactions()
    {
        $this->relation('aricle', 'attachment_foreignid', 'article_id', array('attachement_type' => 'article'));
        $this->relation('wiki',   'attachment_foreignid', 'wiki_id',    array('attachement_type' => 'wiki'));
        $this->relation('post',   'attachment_foreignid', 'post_id',    array('attachement_type' => 'post'));

    }

}

?>
```
### Selection of post and user of this post (JOIN) 

```php
<?php

$oPost = new m_post();
$oPost->join('user');
$oPost->select(1);
//SELECT post_id_user, post_insert, post_title, post_text, post_count_comment, user.*
//FROM post, user WHERE post_id_user = user_id AND post_id = '1'

?>
```
As a second parameter of a method join we can pass an array of fields (or string - fields separated by space),
which should be selected from the table `user`.

### Selection of post and user of this post (LEFT JOIN)

```php
<?php

$oPost = new m_post();
$oPost->joinLeft('user');
$oPost->select(1);
//SELECT post_id_user, post_insert, post_title, post_text, post_count_comment, user.*
//FROM post LEFT JOIN user ON ( post_id_user = user_id ) WHERE post_id = '1'

?>
```

Selecting users and posts of this user

```php
<?php

$oUser = new m_user();
$oUser->select(1);
$aPost = $oUser->post->selectAll();
//SELECT user_id, user_name, user_email, user_pass WHERE user_id = '1'
//SELECT post_id_user, post_insert, post_title, post_text, post_count_comment FROM post WHERE post_id_user = '1'

?>
```

### Relation one-to-one (an account has one profile and a profile has one account)

```php
<?php

class m_accunt extends f_m
{

    public $accunt_id;
    public $accunt_name;
    public $accunt_email;
    public $accunt_pass;

}

class m_profil extends f_m
{

    public $profil_id;
    public $profil_info1;
    public $profil_info2;

}

 $oAccunt = new m_accunt();
 $oAccunt->join('profil');
 $oAccunt->select(1);

 //SELECT accunt_id, accunt_name, accunt_email, accunt_pass, profil.* FROM user, profil WHERE accunt_id = '1' AND accunt_id = profil_id

?>
```

### Relation many-to-many (bike has many categories and category has many bikes)

Relation many-to-many occurs within use of an additional relation table

```php
<?php

class m_bike extends f_m
{

    public $bike_id;
    public $bike_insert;
    public $bike_title;
    public $bike_text;

}

class m_category extends f_m
{

    public $category_id;
    public $category_name;

}

class m_categorybike extends f_m
{

    public $categorybike_id_category;
    public $categorybike_id_bike;

}
?>

Selecting all posts and their categories

<?php

 $oCategorybike = new m_categorybike();
 $oCategorybike->field(false); //it means that no field of this model should be selected
 $oCategorybike->join('bike', 'bike_name');
 $oCategorybike->join('category', 'category_name');
 $oCategorybike->selectAll();
 //SELECT bike_name, category_name FROM categorybike, bike, category
 //WHERE categorybike_id_category = category_id AND  categorybike_id_bike = bike_id
?>
```

### Joining of added model with other foreign model

for example when post has an user and user has a photo

```php
<?php

class m_post extends f_m
{

    public $post_id;
    public $post_id_user;
    public $post_insert;
    public $post_title;
    public $post_text;

}

class m_user extends f_m
{

        public $user_id;
        public $user_name;
        public $user_email;
        public $user_pass;
}

class m_img extends f_m
{
        public $img_id;
        public $img_desc;
}

$oPost = new m_post();
$oPost->join('user', 'user_name');
$oPost->join('img', 'img_desc', 'user'); //third parameter - name of the foreign model to connect to or null if connecting with current model
$oPost->select(1);
//SELECT post_id, post_id_user, post_insert, post_title, post_text, user_name, img_desc
//FROM post, user, img
//WHERE post_id = '1' AND post_id_user = user_id AND user_id_img = img_id

?>
```
### Joining model with another one many times 

private message has sender and receiver

```php
<?php

class m_user extends f_m
{

    public $user_id;
    public $user_name;
    public $user_email;
    public $user_pass;

}

class m_pm extends f_m
{

    public $pm_id;
    public $pm_id_user_form;
    public $pm_id_user_to;
    public $pm_text;

}

?>
```

Getting the message with ID 1

```php
<?php

 $oPm = new m_pm();
 $oPm->field('pm_text');
 $oPm->join(array('f' => 'user_from'), array('userfrom' => 'user_name'));
 $oPm->join(array('t' => 'user_to'  ), array('userto'   => 'user_name'));
 $oPm->select(1);
 //SELECT pm_text, f.user_name as userfrom, t.user_name as userto
 //FROM pm, user as f, user as t
 //WHERE pm_id = '1' AND pm_id_user_from = f.user_id AND pm_id_user_to = t.user_id
 
?>
```

Getting all the messages which were sent by user with ID 1

```php
<?php

$oUser = new m_user();
$oUser->user_id = 1;
$oUser->pm_from->selectAll();

//SELECT pm_id, pm_id_user_form, pm_id_user_to, pm_text FROM pm WHERE pm_id_user_from = '1'

?>
```

### Connecting the model with another one many times and joining the attached model with other foreign model

```php
<?php

class m_pm extends f_m
{

    public $pm_id;
    public $pm_id_user_form;
    public $pm_id_user_to;
    public $pm_text;

}

class m_user extends f_m
{

    public $user_id;
    public $user_name;
    public $user_email;
    public $user_pass;


}

class m_img extends f_m
{

    public $img_id;
    public $img_desc;

}

?>
```

Getting the message with ID 1, joining the user who sent the message and the user who received the message, additionally join the image of the user who received the message

```php
<?php

$oPm = new m_pm();
$oPm->field('pm_text');
$oPm->join(array('f' => 'user_from'), array('userfrom' => 'user_name'));
$oPm->join(array('t' => 'user_to'  ), array('userto'   => 'user_name'));
$oPm->join('img', 'img_desc', array('t' => 'user'));
$oPm->select(1);

//SELECT pm_text, f.user_name as userfrom, t.user_name as userto, img_desc
//FROM pm, user as f, user as t, img
//WHERE
//      pm_id = '1'
//      AND pm_id_user_from = f.user_id

Getting the message with ID 1 and joining the user who sent the message and user who received the message, additionally joining the image of both users

```php
<?php
 $oPm = new m_pm();
 $oPm->field('pm_text');
 $oPm->join(array('f'  => 'user_from'), array('userfrom'    => 'user_name'));
 $oPm->join(array('t'  => 'user_to'  ), array('userto'      => 'user_name'));
 $oPm->join(array('fi' => 'img'      ), array('userfromimg' => 'img_desc'), array('f' => 'user'));
 $oPm->join(array('ti' => 'img'      ), array('usertoimg'   => 'img_desc'), array('t' => 'user'));
 $oPm->select(1);
 //SELECT pm_text, f.user_name as userfrom, t.user_name as userto, fi.img_desc as userfromimg, ti.img_desc as usertoimg
 //FROM pm, user as f, user as t, img as fi, img as ti
 //WHERE
 //      pm_id = '1'
 //      AND pm_id_user_from = f.user_id
 //      AND pm_id_user_to = t.user_id
 //      AND f.user_id_img = fi.img_id
 //      AND t.user_id_img = ti.img_id
