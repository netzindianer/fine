# View

## Container

The view has got the container responsible for views helpers/services.
The container is accessible by the property `_c` so `$this->_c`.

In views there is no fast referring to helpers, so  `$this->head` will not return the object of a helper head.
Fast calls are working  `$this->head()`


## Helpers

### f_v_helper_run

Runs controllers methods.

`<?= $this->run('sidebar', 'newslist') ?>` will run `c_sidebar->newslist()`
